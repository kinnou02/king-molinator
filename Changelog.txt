v1.5.1

LibSUnit
* New: Added event Event.SafesUnitLib.Unit.Detail.Position (X or Y or Z position has changed) table{[UnitID] = UnitObj}
* New: Added a clean method for retrieving Unit objects. UnitObj = LibSUnit:RequestDetails(UnitID)
* Note: Using this method will create the Unit if available, or return an existing unit object.
* New: Now checks for .relation member during the standard damage/heal handler. If changed, this will trigger Event.SafesUnitLib.Unit.Detail.Relation(table{Key = UID, Value = UnitObject})
* Note: The Rift Addon API still doesn't support native Event.Unit.Detail.Relation, so until it does, the above will remain in the standard damage/heal handler.
* Fixed: Prevented UnitObj.Health sometimes being nil.
* Fixed: Table entry errors for new units created via Unit.Target.
* Fixed: Some odd behaviour with cross-shard raid messages.

Res Master
* Fixed: Graphical glitch with some death states. This should now be more reliable.

Encounters
* Fixed: Moved Combat state checking higher in the condition stage to prevent false encounter starts, and Mods locking themselves from starting correctly.
* Note: Recently I've noticed Mobs and Players having no combat state both in-game and via the Addon API, this was messing with KBM's Encounter validity states.
* Change: Should a Mod incorrectly attempt a start due to unusual client states, KBM will hard reset the mod preventing it from locking up entirely.

Menu
* Fixed: All custom color settings will now work as intended. It'll remember default colors, and last color chosen when switching to/from custom.
* Change: Custom colors for objects are applied immediately.

Notify and Chat Events

* Change: Prevented capture method sending nil for Target.

* New: Engine and Bars for all Encounters.
* New: Global Encounter Castbar settings are just that, regardless of Multi-boss fights. 
* New: Castbar placement is now based on relative screen coordinates rather than absolute.
* New: Encounter castbars automatically dock to the global anchor and expand outward should more than 1 be casting at a time.
* Change: Overriding Global Encounter Castbar settings will allow you to disable/enable, pin/unpin and/or scale on a per castbar basis.
* Change: All cast, channel and interrupt triggers are now handled via the new engines event system.
* Change: Maximum castbar size has been increased to 200%.
* Change: Pinned castbars inherit the Global Encounter Castbar settings.
* Change: Custom castbars retain Style and Texture settings from global settings. These cannot be changed individually.
* Change: Simple style castbars now follow the same 
* Removed: Old KBM Castbar system has been completely removed freeing up CPU cycles for KBM's main loop.

Phase Monitor
* Change: Added a catch for cases when the monitor incorrectly starts and remains visible.
